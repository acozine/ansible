   :alt: Cowsay 404

For Ansible 2.9 (currently supported by Red Hat), refer to the `2.9 module index page <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/modules_by_category.html>`_.

For Ansible 2.10, refer to the :ref:`2.10 collection index page <list_of_collections>`. You can also use the navigation at left to explore. Once you find a non-404 page, you can use the version-changer to select a version.
