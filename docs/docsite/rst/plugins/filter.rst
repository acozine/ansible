Filter Plugins

Filter plugins manipulate data. With the right filter you can extract a particular value, transform data types and formats, perform mathematical calculations, split and concatenate strings, insert dates and times, and do much more.  Ansible leverages the :ref:`standard filters <jinja2:builtin-filters>` shipped with Jinja2 and adds some specialized filter plugins. You can :ref:`create custom Ansible filters as plugins <developing_filter_plugins>`.

.. _enabling_filter:

Enabling filter plugins
----------------------

You can add a custom filter plugin by dropping it into a ``filter_plugins`` directory adjacent to your play, inside a role, or by putting it in one of the filter plugin directory sources configured in :ref:`ansible.cfg <ansible_configuration_settings>`.
